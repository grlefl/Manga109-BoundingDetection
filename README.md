## Project Status 
This project achieved minimum viable results. [Next Steps](#next-steps) are listed below.

## Overview 
This project uses a supervised machine-learning model to detect face, text, body, and frames in various manga spreads. The model also draws a bounding box for each object that is detected. 

face = **coral**, text = **teal**, body = **mustard**, frame = **navy**

## Dataset 
The [Manga109](http://www.manga109.org/en/) dataset was used for this project. It is the largest dataset for manga (Japanese comic) images, that is made publicly available for academic research purposes with proper copyright notation.

To download images/annotations of Manga109, please visit [here](http://www.manga109.org/en/download.html) and send an application via the form. After that, you will receive the password for downloading images (109 titles of manga as jpeg files) and annotations (bounding box coordinates of face, body, frame, and speech balloon with texts, in the form of XML).
